# Context data

Often, scopes are connected with external events: HTTP-requests, message from queue, callbacks from framework.

These events can be represented by some objects which can be used for dependencies creation.

There are several providers with access to such context data. You can read more here:

```{eval-rst}
.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    ../providers/context-providers
```
